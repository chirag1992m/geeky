Given a binary tree in the form of an array where the value at each index is the parent of the index, find the height of the binary tree. 
For example , if arr[i] = j, j is the parent of i. If arr[k] = -1, k is the root.

Write a function which takes in an array and its size as input and returns the height as output. The function signature would be of the following form:
int height(int arr[], int size)

Example 

Assume a binary tree where 2 is the root. 1 is the left child of 2 and 0 is the right child of 2. 
Now the given input array will be of the following form : arr = {2,2,-1} which boils down to the following observation :
arr[0] = 2, 2 is the parent of 0
arr[1] = 2, 2 is the parent of 1
arr[2] = -1, 2 is the root

The output should be 1 which is the height of this binary tree.
